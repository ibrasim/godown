                      <h4>Week-1 Assult and Battery </h4>
                      <p class="p-4 bg-primary text-white">
                        “I take no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of this page. The information is collected / copied from lecture notes and other sources. There are no guarantees of completeness, accuracy" S1409011639 </p>

                        Assault means physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury; excluding indecent/sexual assault. 'Assault' leading to death should also be excluded. (1) touches or injures such person, or (2) puts such person in fear of imminent bodily injury. Ingredients of assault - intended to cause apprehension of harmful or offensive contact and the act indeed caused apprehension in the victim that harmful or offensive contact would occur Actus of assault: the victim must apprehend immediate, unlawful, personal violence <mark>What Are the Differences Between Simple and Aggravated Assault? Simple assault is the least serious form of assault and usually involves minor injury or a limited threat of violence. Aggravated assault involves circumstances that make the crime more serious, as when the victim is threatened </mark>with a weapon or experiences violence. <mark>Comparison of assault / battery: There are two different types of assault: common assault and battery. </mark>Common assault is when apprehension of immediate unlawful violence is caused. Battery is when unlawful violence on another person is exerted. Successful claims for both common assault and battery must prove that the actions were committed with intention or recklessness. Battery is, in many ways, the completion of an assault. Battery is defined as an intentional offensive or harmful touching of another person that is done without his or her consent. Since an assault is the threatening of harm, and a battery is the actual act of harm, the two crimes are often charged together.
</p>

 <h4>Week-2 Sexual Offences </h4>
 <p class="p-4 bg-danger text-white">
    A sexual offence occurs when your physical body is interfered with in an inappropriate way by another person, that is when a person <mark>deliberately touches any part of your body including [by that person's touching your private parts in a sexual manner </mark> or way and or by sexual intercourse, all without your permission or consent. sexual offence: “Sexual Assault” means the touching of a sexual organ of a person, with or without a sexual intent by another person, with or without the use of an object or a tool, without consent, and in a manner, which would not constitute it a Rape or Sexual Injury, where the two persons are not married. Or it is forcing a person to reveal his sexual organ without his consent. Or causing an injury to a person’s sexual organ without his consent. Or causing any other degrading act on the sexual organ of a person’s sexual organ without his consent. <mark> Types of sexual offences :1) Rape 2) Sexual Assault by penetration 3) Sexual Assault</mark>
    Rape means the insertion, however minute, of a person’s sexual organ into a sexual organ or an organ which is not a sexual organ of another person without consent, where the two persons are not married exceptions of sexual offence act : <mark> A husband having sexual intercourse with his wife without her consent shall be considered marital rape </mark>  under the following exceptional circumstances, the completion of an assault. Battery is defined as an intentional offensive or harmful touching of another person that is done without his or her consent. <mark>Since an assault is the threatening of harm, and a battery is the actual act of harm, </mark> the two crimes are often charged together.
    
</p>
<h4>week-3 Homicide </h4>
<p class="p-4 bg-success text-white">
The word "homicide" is neutral: it merely means the killing of one human being by another human being. 
Homicides may be justifiable, excusable or criminal. Justifiable homicide - Justifiable homicides are killings which are commanded or authorized by law. Excusable homicide - Excusable homicides are killings of human beings which are not deserving of punishment. Excusable homicide - Excusable homicides are killings of human beings which are not deserving of punishment.<br>
CRIMINAL HOMICIDE: A criminal homicide is any unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being. <br>
Criminal homicides come in two basic varieties: murder and manslaughter. <br>
Murder is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being with malice aforethought.  <br>
Manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought <br>
Murder (a) Offense Defined. A person commits an offense if he knowingly causes the death of another person. <br>
(b) Reckless Murder. A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. 
(c) Felony-Murder Rebuttable Presumption. The trier of fact shall presume, subject to rebuttal, the existence of the recklessness and extreme 
indifference required in Subsection (b) if: (1) the person is engaged in or is an 
accomplice in the commission, attempt to commit, or flight after commission of (2) any violent offense.<br>
Murder is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being with malice aforethought. <br>
Malice aforethought is a state of mind which distinguishes murders from manslaughters.<br>
Malice aforethought does not require that the killer be angry or vindictive toward his victim, nor does it require that the killer think about what he is doing before he does it. A prosecutor must prove any one of these states of mind to establish that a killer had malice aforethought when he killed. <br>
elements of first degree murder: In order to classify murders in different degrees, criminal law highlights various elements or aspects to take into consideration. A 1st-degree murder must have three key aspects:<br>
Intent: A 1st-degree murder must be committed with some sort of intent to kill the person. The murderer must therefore have attacked or harmed their victim with the purpose of ending their life or doing evil.<br>
Deliberation and Premeditation: Deliberation and premeditation are essential parts of quantifying a first-degree murder. This type of crime must be purposeful and planned out, rather than simply occurring in the heat of the moment.<br>
“Malice Aforethought”: “Malice aforethought” is a legal term that basically means that a person who committed the murder did so with an intent to kill and a general disregard for human life.<br>
the elements of first degree murder as three aspects. they are  Intent: A 1st-degree murder must be committed with some sort of intent to kill the person,Deliberation and Premeditation and Malice Aforethought.<br>
2nd-degree murder is one that doesn’t have any kind of premeditation and may only have been intended to cause harm, rather than death.<br>
Third degree murder - third-degree murders are the complete opposite of first-degree murders. It is also known as manslaughter. Third-degree murder occurs when the defendant kills the victim unintentionally or accidentally. <br>
Manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought, and it comes in two varieties: voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter <br>
Voluntary manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused, intentional killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought and where the following elements are present: <br> 
1-there was an adequate provocation of the accused which would be sufficient to enrage any reasonable person <br>
2 the accused, because of the provocation, attained a mental state referred to as heat of passion, heat of blood, or sudden heat;  <br>
3 the killing of the victim was sudden with no cooling off; and  <br>
4 there was a causal connection between the provocation, the heat of passion, and the killing <br>
Involuntary manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused, unintentional killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought and where the killing results from either: 1. the doing of an unlawful act (not a dangerous felony); or 2. the doing of a lawful act in a criminally negligent manner.
</p>
 <h4>week-4 Diminished Responsibility</h4>
 <p class="p-4 bg-danger text-white">
 MEANING OF DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY : legal doctrine that absolves an accused person of part of the liability for his criminal act if he suffers from such abnormality of mind as to substantially impair his responsibility in committing or being a party to an alleged violation.
The doctrine of diminished responsibility provides a mitigating defense in cases in which the mental disease or defect is not of such magnitude as to exclude criminal responsibility altogether.
<br>
Where the defence of diminished responsibility is successfully pleaded, it has the effect of reducing a murder conviction to manslaughter. 
 three special defences of diminished responsibility, loss of control and suicide pact differ from general defences in that they do not apply to all crimes and also the effect is to reduce criminal liability rather than to absolve the defendant from liability completely.<br>
  <h4>week-5 Criminal Property Damages</h4>
  <p class="p-4 bg-success text-white">
  criminal property damages: a person commits offence if he recklessly and without concent damage property of another or tampers with property causing damage. exceptions include if own property or within legal rights <br>
elements include actus reus,destroy or damages,propery, beloonging to anterh,without lawful excuse,mens rea, intention or recklessness <br>
  </p>
<h4>week-6 Theft</h4>
<p class="p-4 bg-danger text-white">
Theft by Taking or Disposition (a) Offense Defined. A person commits an offense if he: (1) knowingly takes or exerts unauthorized control over the property of another, (2) with the purpose of permanently depriving such other person of possession. (b) Definition. “Property of another” means property to which another person holds a greater claim of right, whether such claim be temporary, permanent, or illegal. A legal person, such as the government or a corporation, may hold a claim of right.<br>
elements of theft: The taking of another person’s property; Without their consent or authorization; and  With the intent to deprive the person of that property.<br>
types of theft: Larceny: Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of another’s property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Larceny is different from theft because it usually refers only to a person’s tangible or personal property (e.g., jewelry or a book). Also, although larceny is a type of theft, a theft is not always considered larceny; <br>
Embezzlement: Embezzlement occurs when a person who is entrusted to handle the finances (e.g., an employee or bookkeeper) of another person or business, illegally takes the money for their own personal use; <br>
Receiving Stolen Property: It is a crime to purchase or accept property that a person knows or should have known was obtained through theft. In addition to these two elements, the defendant also needs to have the intent to deprive the owner of their property, such as by selling it or keeping it; <br>
Extortion: Extortion, which is similar to blackmail, involves the taking of money, services, or property through force by means of threat or intimidation. The threats do not need to be followed through on immediately. They can be carried out at some later time in the future;<br>
Burglary and Robbery:The elements of burglary consist of the unlawful breaking and entering into another person’s home or building for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Burglary becomes the crime of robbery when the individual commits a theft with the use of threat or force. Also, robbery will be elevated to the crime of armed robbery if it involves the use of a weapon.<br> 
One other element that differs between the two is that burglary requires a breaking and entering, whereas robbery does not; <br>

<h2>CONSTITUTIONAL LAW</h2>
<h4>week-1 Introduction to Constitution </h4>
why: what we need to live decently with dignity in a civic society <br>
James Madison, US 4th president :People need government, if men were angels,  no government would be necessary <br>
fundamental things humans need: as human beings we all need food, shelter,education,security,protection from violence and des rimnation, recogination and respecit and freedom or rights <br>
people create government and dedicat power to them to lay out a mechanism to deliver the fundamental things mentioned above <br>
problem: we need to give power to perform funcgtions of government <br>
power without limit lead to corruption, dictatorship and oppresion <br>
power problem: election will of people, need of basic rules USAGE and PROTECTION <br>
why we need constitution- we need rules, supreme law, organize, determine and difficult tot change the laws <br>
to solve the power problem consitution give control to people <br>
to solve the power problem in two ways ORGANIZATION and CONSTRAINING <br>
divisionof power - presidition, parliament (national/state/municipal) <br>
rotation - election <br>
separation of powers -court , military, police, civil service <br>
constraints by must and must not <br>
must do - cannot be touchered, cnnot imprision without due cause, freedom of speech <br>
must do- eduction, health care, sanitation, housing,safeguard <br>
CONSTITUTION <br>
constitution is the supreme low of the land <br>
it contains laws relation between different leves of goverment and between governmetn and citizens <br>
<h4>week-2 Functions of the constitution </h4>
a modern consitution should reflect <br>
Q.1     How is the legislative executive and judicial organs structured and how it is   <br>
organised;What are the powers given to legislative, executive and judiciary; What is the mutual relationship between legislative, executive and judiciary;What is the relation between these organs and the people; What type of government the state has <br>
it is in various chapters of Maldivian consitution <br>
eg: Chapter I ,III, IV,  V,  VI ,II,  VII, XI, XII of Maldivian Constitution. <br>
constitution can be written or unwritten <br>
the type of government can be unitary or federal <br>
federal has multiple hierarchy levels with both the central authority and the state (or proviences both being sovereign)<br>
central or national override the state rule <br>
there is a balance between tthe leels of government <br>
power and responsibility shared betwen the national locallevels <br>
unitary no hierarchy of soverne powers <br>
in unitary central or national government can orrder the state to do anything <br>
unitary has huge percentage of power <br>
tpe of government can be presidential or parliamentary <br>
in presidental- political and administative powers are devided between executive legeslative and judicial branches <br>
head -president <br>
presidet elect directly by the people and answerable to voters <br>
parliament-prime minister and cabinet is executive authority and derived from legislature <br>
head - clear differntiation between head of government and head of state <br>
election and responsibliyt- pm member of parliament elected by ruling party <br>
<h4>week-3 Entrenchment </h4>
the process by which ideas became fixed and cannot be changed <br>
a concept in which certain ammendments either moredifficult or impossible to pass <br>
if done it becomes invalid <br>
also konwns ans eternatiy clause or rigidity  <br>
protects the governmnet, rights on individuals also protects institutiona and rights against legal change <br>
eg- ammendment of the consitution 261 <br>
eg- non assent by president and national referrendum <br>
<h4>week-4 constitutionalism</h4>

<h4>week-5 Parliamentary supermacy</h4>
supremacy in law context :Highest authority of some (fundamental) norms, institutions or branches of power in a certain legal system. <br>
Any rule inconsistent with a constitutional rule is an invalid rule. <br>
Any rule inconsistent with a constitutional rule is an invalid rule. <br>
OR we may say that all laws and conduct must conform to the prescripts of the constitution <br>
In this sense, the constitution is the ultimate authority for law-making and lawful conduct. <br>
constitional supermacy is found in Maldives consitution as THE POWERS OF THE STATE SHALL BE EXERCISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS CONSITUTION <br>
Constitutional Supremacy— Counter-Majoritarian dilemma <br>
when all state organs ar bound by supreme consitution,in a democratic state it gives rise to counter majoritiaran dilemma <br>
becuase when parliement gets powers and majority gets the power to do certain if not all <br>
showing maajoirty determain the ruls of the state <br>
then if majoiryt of people can overrule constitutionrules then question becomes how is consitution supereme <br>
This could have implications for minority groups that are not represented by the majority in Parliament but whom a constitution seeks to protect <br>
how is it addressed in Maldives consitution- independe judeges  / islamic sharia when deciding  matters related to consitution <br>
Maldives constititional allow judges to function without impartily fear and prejudice. <br>

<h4>week-7 </h4>
to do

<h4>week-8 islamic constitutionalism </h4>
sources are the Quran, the sunnah Ijma and Qiyas <br>
1. Change in Time, Place and Circumstance <br>
basic sharia principle - A major principle of Islamic jurisprudence is that laws may change with the passage of time and the change of place or circumstances <br>
2. Necessity/Avoidance of Harm <br>
This principle has also been stated in terms of choosing the lesser of two evils. Several Qur'anic ayahs as well as the hadith clearly permit the prohibited in case of necessity or severe harm. <br>
Some ayahs state that God will forgive anyone who breaks the law under duress. <br>
A famous saying of the Prophet is that Islam is a religion of facilitation not complication. <br>
For this reason, the all four schools of Islamic thought, permitted drinking alcohol and eating pork out of necessity. <br>
3. Cessation of Cause <br>
Where an Islamic law applies to specific factual situations, the existence of the law itself is dependent on the continued existence of that factual situation. <br>
For example, the Qur'an encouraged Muslims to give a certain group of Arabs, called "al-Mu'allafatu Qulubuhum," a share in the charitable donations paid by Muslims. <br>
COMPATIBILITY OF DIVINE LAW WITH A DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT <br>
But any law passed by legislature (i.e., the majority) if contradictory to Constitution (e.g., USA) will be declared as VOID. <br>
Anti Majoritarian Difficulty <br>
Quran & Judicial majlis Shura for Unconstitutionality or Ghair Sharai’ Qawaid <br>
Since the Qur'an provides the basic structure of governance and essential values, a Muslim legislature needs to promulgate a multitude of laws in the process of governance, just as the U.S. legislature does. <br>
The Muslims who would have the power of "judicial review" in the Muslim state would be those of a judicial majlis shura, <br>
As explained earlier, Islam is flexible, and part of its flexibility lies in the ability to interpret and supplement the Qur'an, in ways consistent with the Qur'an, to produce laws suitable to a certain epoch and society. <br>
While the additions will have the weight of constitutional laws, they will never, however, be confused with divine laws.  <br>
Separation of Powers <br>
In the days of the Prophet, all legislative, executive and judicial powers rested with him. This arrangement made sense during that period, since the Prophet was the Messenger of God who was in charge of teaching Muslims the basic principles of Islam, as well as showing them how to act and live in accordance with these principles. <br>
In worldly matters, like those of agriculture or warfare, the Prophet consulted the experts. He also repeatedly encouraged Muslims to do the same. <br>
Furthermore, the Prophet was in the habit of consulting with other Muslims, and at times followed the advice of Muslims even when he clearly disagreed with it. Such was his respect for the consultative process that. <br>
Separation of Powers <br>
After the Prophet, al-Khulafa' al-Rashideen followed in the Prophet's footsteps to the extent possible. Since the revelation of the Qur'an was completed before the Prophet’s passing, Muslims had to do their best to find the proper laws governing each new situation they encountered based only on the learning the Prophet left them and on common sense. <br>
To minimize error, the khalifahs turned to shura. In matters of religion, other mujtahids were consulted. <br>
On other matters, the khalifahs, following the example of the Prophet, also relied on shura with the appropriate groups. Thus, shura was a hallmark of early Islamic governance. <br>
In the days of the Prophet those who provided shura (the "Shura People") were Wise Ones and ascended to their status by a natural process of recognition by the Muslims at large <br>



<h4> week-9 constitutional principles </h4>
the constitutional principles cosists of POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.The governments right to rule comes from the people is mentined in the article 4 of Maldives Constitutiona which states that all the powers of the
state of the Maldives are derrived from and remain with the state. the constitution rests on the idea of popular sovernty which changes and grows and evolve.<br>
LIMITED GOVERNMENT: the government has power howeverit is giern byt the constitution and is limited. here in the constitution it is written that legislative power is vested in the peoples majlis. it is also mentioned that the executive power is wested with the preseident. it is also mentioned that judicial power is  witin the courts. <br>
it is to be noted that bot the citizens and rulers must obey the law. that means no person or group cy bypass the law.<br>
SEPARATION OF POWERS: the constitutionl separates powers and are declarted such as the parliamen makes laws while the president sitting in the exectuie branche carries  out the laws and thecourts explain and interpret the laws <br>
the objective of power sepeartion is to provide check and balances.<br>
it also provides division of governemtn role into branches <br>
federaslism: a system of government in whihc power is divided between central government and smalll political units such as states.<br>
dual sovernity means powers are clearly defined and runs with little overlap <br>
delegate powers: consitution aasigns certain powers to national governments <br>
reserved powers: poers kept by the state consurrnetpowers: powers shared by national and state govermetns <br>
Maldvies a unitary form of government <br>
 unitary vs federal <br>
federal has multiple hierarch levels while unitary has not such hierarchy <br>
in federal cetnral or nationl rule overides state rules while in unitary the national governmen can order stat to do anything <br>
in federal there are balance in level of govenrment while <br>
in unitary/Federal huge percentage of power given to government. <br>
republicanism-Citizens elect representatives to carry out their will. based ont eh belief that he people exercise their power by voting for their political representatives. <br>
Civic Republicanism is the idea that citizens stay informed about politics and participate in the process. <br>
in presidential: political and administrative powers are devided betweent the executive and leglistave and judical branches. presidnet is that head. president electd by voters and answerable to voters<br>

<h2>Law of Contract II</h2>
<h4> week -2 Terms of contract </h4>

terms and representations,collateral contracts, parol evidence rule <br>
A term is something that is in the contract that are made by one of the parties to the
agreement which defines their undertakings and without it the party would not have made
their way into the contract. <br>
A representation is a statement that one of the parties have made during the negotiations
which is not mentioned in the contract <br>
How do the Courts decide whether it is a ‘term’ or a‘representation’?.<br>
it is done on the following: Time factor, Importance of the statement, Knowledge of the parties, The manner in which the statement was made, The statement reduced to writing <br>
Collateral Contract is a A subsidiary contract where the parties to one contract enter into or a promise to
enter into another contract, Both contracts can exist side by side <br>
Parol evidence is any agreement between the parties that is not contained in the
contract in written form. <br>
The courts will uphold and enforce expressed terms. <br>
The express terms represent intention of the parties at the time they entered into
the contract <br>

<h4>week 4 - classification of terms </h4>
1. Express and Implied Terms <br>
2. Terms implied by Courts and Statute <br>
3. Conditions, Warranties and Innominate terms <br>
4. Standard form contracts <br>
1. An express is a term that is expressly agreed between the contracting parties. This is done via writing the terms they have agreed upon or, Verbally, where they have discussed and agreed between the parties about what 
they want <br>
2. Implied terms are terms that are not expressed in the contract but are taken to be as  effective as if they had been included in the contract <br>
3. A contract has implied terms that are read into the agreement, by the courts or through statute.Terms implied in law are not terms that the parties would have agreed to, but rather terms that arise as a legal incident of a particular legal relationship.<br>
limited circumstances where court may decide implied if terms applied throuh custom , fact,law etc <br>
terms implied as fact are based on either business efficacy test or officius bystander test <br>
business efficacy test: Is the term necessary to give the contract business efficacy? This means that would the contract make business sense without it? <br>
bystander test: when an officious bystander or a third party had been there at the time the contract was in the making and had suggested that such a term should be included, obviously both parties to the contract would have agreed to incorporate it in the contract. <br>
3. Conditions, Warranties, and Innominate terms A condition is a major term of the contract which goes to the depth of the contract. It can be inferred that a condition goes directly to the root of the contract. If a condition is breached the innocent party is entitle to repudiate ie. end the contract and claim damages.<br>
warranties <br>
Warranties are minor terms of a contract which are not central to the existence of the contract. If a warranty is breached the innocent party may claim damages but it is NOT a term when breached that would end the contract.<br>
innominate terms <br>
Standard form contracts <br>
These are contracts where the terms and conditions are put forward by one party and the other party is not given an opportunity to negotiate or amend those terms and conditionsThey are non-negotiated provisions, usually in preprinted forms.These are sometimes referred to as “boilerplate contracts,” “contracts of adhesion,” or “take it or leave it” contracts. <br>
