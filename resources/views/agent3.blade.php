                <h2>CRIMINAL LAW</h2>
                <h4>week-1 assult and battery </h4>

Assault' means physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury; excluding indecent/sexual assault; threats and slapping/punching. 'Assault' leading to death should also be excluded.<br>
(1) touches or injures such person, or  (2) puts such person in fear of imminent bodily injury.<br>
Ingredients of assult - intended to cuase apprehensionof harmful or offensive contact and the act indeed caused
appreshesion in the victim that harmful or offensive contact wourld occur <br>
Actus of assult: the victim must apprehend immeidate, unlaowrul, personal violence<br>
What Are the Differences Between Simple and Aggravated Assault? Simple assault is the least serious form of assault and usually involves minor injury or a limited threat of violence. Aggravated assault involves circumstances that make the crime more serious, as when the victim is threatened with a weapon or experiences violence amounting to significantly more than a minor slap across the face or a punch in the jaw <br>
comparision of assult / battery :There are two different types of assault: common assault and battery. Common assault is when apprehension of immediate unlawful violence is caused.
 Battery is when unlawful violence on another person is exerted. Successful claims for both common assault and battery must prove that the actions were committed with intention or recklessness.  <br>
 battery:Battery is, in many ways, the completion of an assault. Battery is defined as an intentional offensive or harmful touching of another person that is done without his or her consent. Since an assault is the threatening of harm, and a battery is the actual act of harm, the two crimes are often charged together.<br>
<h4>week-2 sexual offences </h4>
Meaning: A sexual offence occurs when your physical body is interfered with in an inappropriate way by another person, that is when a person deliberately touches any part of your body including [by that person's touching] your private parts in a sexual manner or way and/or by sexual intercourse, all without your permission or consent.<br>
sexual offence: “Sexual Assault” means the touching of a sexual organ of a person, with or without a sexual intent by another person, with or without the use of an object or a tool, without consent, and in a manner, which would not constitute it a Rape or Sexual Injury, where the two persons are not married. Or it is forcing a person to reveal his sexual organ without his consent. Or causing an injury to a person’s sexual organ without his consent. Or causing any other degrading act on the sexual organ of a person’s sexual organ without his consent. <br>
types of sexual offences :1) Rape 2) Sexual Assault by penetration 3) Sexual Assault <br>
“Rape” means the insertion, however minute, of a person’s sexual organ into a sexual organ or an organ which is not a sexual organ of another person without consent, where the two persons are not married <br>
exceptions of sexual offence act :A husband having sexual intercourse with his wife without her consent shall be considered marital rape under the following exceptional circumstances <br>
s, the completion of an assault. Battery is defined as an intentional offensive or harmful touching of another person that is done without his or her consent. Since an assault is the threatening of harm, and a battery is the actual act of harm, the two crimes are often charged together.<br>
<h4>week-3 Homicide </h4>
The word "homicide" is neutral: it merely means the killing of one human being by another human being. 
Homicides may be justifiable, excusable or criminal. Justifiable homicide - Justifiable homicides are killings which are commanded or authorized by law. Excusable homicide - Excusable homicides are killings of human beings which are not deserving of punishment. Excusable homicide - Excusable homicides are killings of human beings which are not deserving of punishment.<br>
CRIMINAL HOMICIDE: A criminal homicide is any unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being. <br>
Criminal homicides come in two basic varieties: murder and manslaughter. <br>
Murder is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being with malice aforethought.  <br>
Manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought <br>
Murder (a) Offense Defined. A person commits an offense if he knowingly causes the death of another person. <br>
(b) Reckless Murder. A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of another person under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. 
(c) Felony-Murder Rebuttable Presumption. The trier of fact shall presume, subject to rebuttal, the existence of the recklessness and extreme 
indifference required in Subsection (b) if: (1) the person is engaged in or is an 
accomplice in the commission, attempt to commit, or flight after commission of (2) any violent offense.<br>
Murder is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being with malice aforethought. <br>
Malice aforethought is a state of mind which distinguishes murders from manslaughters.<br>
Malice aforethought does not require that the killer be angry or vindictive toward his victim, nor does it require that the killer think about what he is doing before he does it. A prosecutor must prove any one of these states of mind to establish that a killer had malice aforethought when he killed. <br>
elements of first degree murder: In order to classify murders in different degrees, criminal law highlights various elements or aspects to take into consideration. A 1st-degree murder must have three key aspects:<br>
Intent: A 1st-degree murder must be committed with some sort of intent to kill the person. The murderer must therefore have attacked or harmed their victim with the purpose of ending their life or doing evil.<br>
Deliberation and Premeditation: Deliberation and premeditation are essential parts of quantifying a first-degree murder. This type of crime must be purposeful and planned out, rather than simply occurring in the heat of the moment.<br>
“Malice Aforethought”: “Malice aforethought” is a legal term that basically means that a person who committed the murder did so with an intent to kill and a general disregard for human life.<br>
the elements of first degree murder as three aspects. they are  Intent: A 1st-degree murder must be committed with some sort of intent to kill the person,Deliberation and Premeditation and Malice Aforethought.<br>
2nd-degree murder is one that doesn’t have any kind of premeditation and may only have been intended to cause harm, rather than death.<br>
Third degree murder - third-degree murders are the complete opposite of first-degree murders. It is also known as manslaughter. Third-degree murder occurs when the defendant kills the victim unintentionally or accidentally. <br>
Manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought, and it comes in two varieties: voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter <br>
Voluntary manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused, intentional killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought and where the following elements are present: <br> 
1-there was an adequate provocation of the accused which would be sufficient to enrage any reasonable person <br>
2 the accused, because of the provocation, attained a mental state referred to as heat of passion, heat of blood, or sudden heat;  <br>
3 the killing of the victim was sudden with no cooling off; and  <br>
4 there was a causal connection between the provocation, the heat of passion, and the killing <br>
Involuntary manslaughter is the unjustified, unexcused, unintentional killing of one human being by another human being without malice aforethought and where the killing results from either: 1. the doing of an unlawful act (not a dangerous felony); or 2. the doing of a lawful act in a criminally negligent manner.
 <br>
 <h4>week-4 Diminished Responsibility</h4>
 MEANING OF DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY : legal doctrine that absolves an accused person of part of the liability for his criminal act if he suffers from such abnormality of mind as to substantially impair his responsibility in committing or being a party to an alleged violation.
The doctrine of diminished responsibility provides a mitigating defense in cases in which the mental disease or defect is not of such magnitude as to exclude criminal responsibility altogether.
<br>
Where the defence of diminished responsibility is successfully pleaded, it has the effect of reducing a murder conviction to manslaughter. 
 three special defences of diminished responsibility, loss of control and suicide pact differ from general defences in that they do not apply to all crimes and also the effect is to reduce criminal liability rather than to absolve the defendant from liability completely.<br>
 <h4>week-5 Criminal Property Damages</h4>
 criminal property damages: a person commits offence if he recklessly and without concent damage property of another or tampers with property causing damage. exceptions include if own property or within legal rights <br>
elements include actus reus,destroy or damages,propery, beloonging to anterh,without lawful excuse,mens rea, intention or recklessness <br>
<h4>week-6 Theft</h4>
Theft by Taking or Disposition (a) Offense Defined. A person commits an offense if he: (1) knowingly takes or exerts unauthorized control over the property of another, (2) with the purpose of permanently depriving such other person of possession. (b) Definition. “Property of another” means property to which another person holds a greater claim of right, whether such claim be temporary, permanent, or illegal. A legal person, such as the government or a corporation, may hold a claim of right.<br>
elements of theft: The taking of another person’s property; Without their consent or authorization; and  With the intent to deprive the person of that property.<br>
types of theft: Larceny: Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of another’s property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Larceny is different from theft because it usually refers only to a person’s tangible or personal property (e.g., jewelry or a book). Also, although larceny is a type of theft, a theft is not always considered larceny; <br>
Embezzlement: Embezzlement occurs when a person who is entrusted to handle the finances (e.g., an employee or bookkeeper) of another person or business, illegally takes the money for their own personal use; <br>
Receiving Stolen Property: It is a crime to purchase or accept property that a person knows or should have known was obtained through theft. In addition to these two elements, the defendant also needs to have the intent to deprive the owner of their property, such as by selling it or keeping it; <br>
Extortion: Extortion, which is similar to blackmail, involves the taking of money, services, or property through force by means of threat or intimidation. The threats do not need to be followed through on immediately. They can be carried out at some later time in the future;<br>
Burglary and Robbery:The elements of burglary consist of the unlawful breaking and entering into another person’s home or building for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Burglary becomes the crime of robbery when the individual commits a theft with the use of threat or force. Also, robbery will be elevated to the crime of armed robbery if it involves the use of a weapon.<br> 
One other element that differs between the two is that burglary requires a breaking and entering, whereas robbery does not; <br>
